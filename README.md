# Logic

*Evaluate the validity, satisfiability and entailment of logical sentences.*

Technically, this code implements an interpreter performing the following steps:

1. lexical analysis
2. parsing of tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation
3. function execution on the AST

Currently supported: expressions in propositional logic (PL)
